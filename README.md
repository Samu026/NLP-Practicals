Experiment Group 1-1: Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE) using NLTK library. Use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer for stemming. Use any technique for lemmatization.


Experiment Group 1-2: Perform bag-of-words approach (count occurrence, normalized count occurrence), TF-IDF on data. Create embeddings using Word2Vec.


Experiment Group 1-3:  Perform text cleaning, perform lemmatization (any method), remove stop words (any method), label encoding. Create representations using TF-IDF. Save outputs.


Experiment Group 1-4: Create a transformer from scratch using the Pytorch library.


Experiment Group 1-5: Morphology is the study of the way words are built up from smaller meaning bearing units. Study and understand the concepts of morphology by the use of add delete table.
